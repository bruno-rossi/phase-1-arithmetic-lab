// Write your code here

let num1 = 31;

let num2 = 2;

let multiply = num1 * num2;


// Math.random() returns a number between 0 and 0.999..., which we multiply by 10 to give us a number between 0 and 9.999.... We then pass that number to Math.floor(), which returns an integer between 0 and 9. That's one less than the desired range (1 to 10), so we add one at the end of the equation:

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;


let num3 = 8;

let num4 = 2;

let mod = num3 / num4;

let max = Math.max(10, 15, 20);
